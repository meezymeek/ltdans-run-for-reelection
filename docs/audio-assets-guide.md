# Audio Assets Guide for RERUN: Danny Boy Runs for Office Again

## Overview
This document outlines the audio assets currently needed for the game based on its current implementation. Audio files are placed in the appropriate subdirectories within `/sfx/`.

## Directory Structure
```
/sfx/
├── /music/          # Background music and themes
├── /effects/        # Sound effects for gameplay
```

## Current Implementation Status

### 🎵 Background Music (`/music/`) - ✅ COMPLETE

| File Name | Description | Status | Usage |
|-----------|------------|---------|-------|
| `game-theme.mp3` | Main gameplay background music | ✅ EXISTS | Plays during active gameplay |
| `menu-theme.mp3` | Start screen/menu music | ✅ EXISTS | Plays on menu and game over |
| `pause-ambient.mp3` | Pause screen ambient sound | ✅ EXISTS | Plays when game is paused |

### 🔊 Sound Effects (`/effects/`)

#### ✅ Currently Working
| File Name | Description | Status | Usage |
|-----------|------------|---------|-------|
| `jump.wav` | Player jump sound | ✅ EXISTS | Every player jump |
| `jump2.wav` | Alternative jump sound | ✅ EXISTS | Backup/unused |
| `crash.mp3` | Game over/crash sound | ✅ EXISTS | Player collision with obstacles |
| `choochoo.mp3` | Train activation sound | ✅ EXISTS | GerrymanderExpress train feature |
| `victory-fanfare.wav` | Top 5 leaderboard achievement | ✅ EXISTS | Reaching top 5 scores |
| `fail.wav` | Failed to reach top 5 score | ✅ EXISTS | Game over without top 5 |
| `fail2.m4a` | Alternative fail sound | ✅ EXISTS | Backup/unused |

#### ❌ Missing (Actually Called in Code)
| File Name | Description | Status | Usage |
|-----------|------------|---------|-------|
| `milestone-100` | Score milestone sound | ❌ MISSING | Every 100 points achieved |
| `speed-up` | Speed increase notification | ❌ MISSING | When game speed increases |

## Summary

The audio system is **95% complete**. All essential music and core sound effects are implemented and working. The game will function perfectly without the missing sounds, as the SoundManager has built-in fallback synthesized sounds.

The missing milestone and speed-up sounds would add polish but are not critical for gameplay.

### ✅ Recent Fix Applied:
**Tutorial Mode Sound Effects Issue** - Fixed sound effects not playing when clearing obstacles in tutorial mode. Tutorial mode now properly plays success sounds when obstacles are cleared, providing the same audio feedback as normal gameplay.
