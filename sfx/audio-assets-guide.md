## Audio Sources & Creation Tips

### Free Resources
1. **Freesound.org** - Creative Commons sounds
2. **Zapsplat.com** - Free with account
3. **OpenGameArt.org** - Game-specific assets
4. **YouTube Audio Library** - Royalty-free music

### Creation Tools
1. **Audacity** (Free) - Record and edit sounds
2. **Bfxr** - Retro game sound generator
3. **ChipTone** - Online sound effect generator
4. **GarageBand** (Mac) - Music creation
5. **FL Studio Mobile** - Mobile music production

### Recording Tips
- Record at highest quality, compress later
- Leave small silence padding at start/end
- For loops, ensure seamless loop points
- Test in-game at various volume levels

## Implementation Notes

### Sound Pooling
Effects that play frequently (jump, points) will use audio pooling with 3-5 instances to allow overlapping playback.

### Volume Levels (Default)
- Master: 70%
- Music: 60%
- Effects: 80%

### Browser Compatibility & Multi-Format Support
The system automatically tries to load files in this priority order:
1. **WAV** format (best quality, larger files)
2. **MP3** format (best compatibility, good compression)
3. **OGG** format (Firefox/Chrome support)
4. **M4A** format (Apple devices)
5. **Fallback** to synthesized sound (if all formats fail)

You only need to provide ONE format per sound - the system will find and use whatever format is available. For best results, provide WAV files if quality is priority, or MP3 files if file size is a concern.

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] All sounds load without errors
- [ ] Music loops seamlessly
- [ ] Effects don't clip or distort
- [ ] Volume balance feels right
- [ ] Mobile performance is smooth
- [ ] Sounds work on muted start (after user interaction)

## License Reminders
- Keep documentation of licenses for all audio
- Credit creators as required
- Verify commercial use if planning monetization
- Consider commissioning original music for uniqueness

## Quick Start for Testing
If you want to quickly test the system while hunting for better audio:

1. Use online generators to create placeholder sounds:
   - Visit: https://sfxr.me/ for quick retro effects
   - Visit: https://www.bfxr.net/ for more options

2. Record your own temporary sounds:
   - "Jump" - Say "whoosh" into your mic
   - "Point" - Tap a glass with a spoon
   - "Collision" - Crumple paper

3. The system will work with whatever you provide and gracefully fallback to synthesized sounds for missing files.
